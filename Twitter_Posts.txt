To question Modia, whenever they spotted outside their studios.. To ask them valid questions.  Questions related with unemployment, economy and women's saftey. |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
Republic TV respecting privacy. |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
See if someone asked Pappu out of the question Congressmen are already having bad days |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
We should do the same thing to anti-national dogs |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
Should we start doing the same thing with  @BDUTT @khanumarfa @RanaAyyub @rohini_sgh @ravishndtv and heckle them at public places for their stances? |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
You can do it with reporters who do the same thing to others like Arnab Goswami and team. If you have seen the journalists you mentioned heckling others, plz go ahead. |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
Inviting some one as panel guests for a debate and abusing them  live on national channel in your studio is not cheap behaviour ? |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
public was happy when manmohansingh never faced media.never given interview, only written speaches for 10 years.This govt.from PM HM to every minister debating answering all the questions. Always democratically pusing there ideas.What trending is just lynch someone and harass gov |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
The problem is that from PM to HM or whosoever till Sambit Patra they don't even know how many zero in 5 trillion and keep on speaking about 5 trillion 5 trillion 5 trillion and by the end of the day not even 05 which result in sharp move from every corner |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
If everyone does his/her job well, we will have a productive population. Let's ask objective questions to govt. If they don't respond, follow up, but don't harras. Harrasment dilutes the gravity of the issue.|Arnab_flight_Real |Real
Question to government? Is Modi planning to give a press conference?|Arnab_flight_Real |Real
If you did in film city Noida ... UP police will arrest you in what ever act.  In Delhi NDMC or SDMC will fined you and Delhi Police may be take action against you.|Arnab_flight_Real |Real
I loved your new creation MODIA  |Arnab_flight_Real |Real
